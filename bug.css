The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where specificity can cause unexpected results: 

```css
div { color: blue; }
.red { color: red; }
div.red { color: green; }
```

In this case, a `<div>` element with the class `red` will be green.  The `div.red` selector is more specific than `.red`, so its declaration takes precedence.

There are several ways to solve this issue, depending on the desired outcome.  Here are two solutions:

**Solution 1: Adjust the selector order:**

```css
.red { color: red; }
div.red { color: green; }
div { color: blue; }
```
By placing the more specific selector before the less specific one, the desired styling precedence is established. If you want the .red to override the div.red, put .red before div.red

**Solution 2: Use !important (generally discouraged):**

```css
div { color: blue; }
.red { color: red !important; }
div.red { color: green; }
```
Adding `!important` to the `.red` declaration forces its color to take precedence.  However, overuse of `!important` can make CSS difficult to maintain, so this should be a last resort.
